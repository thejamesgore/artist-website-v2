Portfolio website for client using React & Sanity for the headless CMS so he can add blog posts and gallery content as required.

ToDo

- Works should show categories of gallery, you click that link THEN list every type of gallery of that type
- Change image size on mobile so picture is taking up full screen
- change bg colour to be consistent across all pages rather than off white
- change LOAD MORE... to More blogs coming soon
- gallery arrows should be outside of images and visible
- dark mode by default
- change favicon to something
- change about section so photos are self portraits
